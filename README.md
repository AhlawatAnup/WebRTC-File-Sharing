# WebRTC-File-Sharing

A simple experiment with WebRTC by using it to transfer files, peer to peer with the help of a custom WebSocket server to do signalling between the peers.
Supports only Chrome browser for now, but will try and get it to work on Firefox also.

You can locally host the website and use it to share files between your devices (Devices need to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the server).
